## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Pick up 10 companies from the FTSE 100 share index(The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, also called the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 100, FTSE, or, informally, the "Footsie" , is a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation) and than:
* Collect news articles from all over the world about these 10 companies and save the latest news to a database of your choice
* Do a classification of the news articles (good news, bad news, neutral news). Try to build an automated text classification algorithm in order to classify the headline news into several categories 
* Analyse the data and show the results about the effects of news on stocks. Try to build a machine learning model using sentiment analysis to predict future stock price fluctuations
