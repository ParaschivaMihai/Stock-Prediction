## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Pick up 10 companies from the FTSE 100 share index(The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, also called the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 100, FTSE, or, informally, the "Footsie" , is a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation)
* Collect news articles from all over the world about these 10 companies and save the latest news to a database of your choice
* Do a classification of the news articles (good news, bad news, neutral news). Try to build an automated text classification algorithm in order to classify the headline news into several categories 
* Analyse the data and show the results about the effects of news on stocks. Try to build a machine learning model using sentiment analysis to predict future stock price fluctuations

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if 
appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
